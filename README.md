# 🎮 **MarioLike**  
**A SFML project in C++ inspired by Mario games**  

## 📜 **Project Description**  
**MarioLike** is an application developed in **C++** using **SFML** and **Box2d**. The goal is to create a game which contains the basic features of a platformer, like the first Mario game.

--- 

### 🚪 **Main Features**  

1. **Movements**  
   - The player is able to move around the map. The jump doesn't work well yet, so for now, the player can also fly.

2. **Levels**
   - The game contains two levels. To access the second one, the player has to finish the first level by reaching the furthest point of the map. 

3. **Enemies**  
   - The player will meet an enemy in the first level. This enemy cannot be killed. The player will die if he gets hit too many times. 

4. **Timer & score**  
   - There's no timer and no score in the game, but the features are ready to be used.  

5. **Game over system**  
   - If the player gets hit too many times by the enemy, or if he falls, he will lose the game and get the game over menu. This menu allows him to start over (this feature doesn't work well for now).

6. **Menus**
   - The game starts with a **menu** where player can begin the game or go on the settings menu (which is not ready for now)

## 🚀 **Installation and Setup**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

### **Installation Steps**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   - Clone the project to your machine using a terminal:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/fl-hugo/PokemonMonster
     ```  

2. **Open the game**
   - Go on "MarioLike\x64\Debug" and open the file named **MarioLike.exe**. You're ready to play ! 🎉

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Language**: C++  
- **Libraries**: SFML & Box2D

---  

## 🎯 **Future Improvements**  
- Fix or include features that are incomplete or non-functional (The start over, timer & score, jump, settings menu).
- Clean the first and second levels, with a different map for each, new tiles (some of which are interactive), more and distinct enemies, and a clear end of level.
- Add some transitions between levels to inform player of his progression.
- Add some animations in the game (for the player's movements, for enemies, when player dies, etc).
- Add sounds and musics
